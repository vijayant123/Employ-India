What is PolicyHack?

PolicyHack is an event bringing Indian policymakers together with top developers to tackle real-world problems standing in the way of a more effective, efficient, and transparent government. Participants will have the opportunity to interact directly with mentors from the top tiers of the policy world to design and build technical solutions to some of today's most pressing policy problems, giving participating developers the unique opportunity to build applications that are immediately relevant and applicable to the challenges that stand in the way of better government.

Who is hosting the event?

PolicyHack is being hosted by Evidence for Policy Design, a Harvard-based research center working in partnership with IFMR LEAD out of an office in Delhi. Evidence for Policy Design seeks to bring data and economic insights to the design and implementation of public policies through direct, long-term engagements with Indian policy partners. PolicyHack is hosted as part of EPoD’s Building Capacity to Use Research Evidence (BCURE) program, funded by the United Kingdom Department for International Development.

Policy Track One: DDU-GKY Trainee Job Placement

Policy Partner: DDU-GKY Skills Division, Ministry of Rural Development

Problem Background: The Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana (DDU-GKY) is the flagship placement-linked skill training programme under the Ministry of Rural Development of the Government of India. DDU-GKY is unique among government skill programmes in its exclusive focus on training poor rural youth. DDU-GKY expects to train 20 lakh rural youth by 2017 in a variety of trades, including retail, BPO services, hospitality, banking and accounting, and more. DDU-GKY embraces the use of IT solutions, and it is India’s first skill training programme to provide tablets for trainees, to require Aadhaar-linked biometric information on attendance, and to mandate geo-tag time-stamped records of training centres and classes. DDU-GKY also distinguishes itself from other training programmes by its focus on candidate retention and career progression. Affiliated training centres are required to place at least 75% of trained candidates in formal sector employment paying at least Rs. 6,000. Currently, placement occurs solely through the training partners’ efforts, and many trainees who are placed migrate far from their native communities for the first time. Another obstacle to employment is the lack of documentation – trainees often have no way to demonstrate police verification (of identity and clean records) or employment history.
Problem Statement: There are many challenges to providing employment opportunities to candidates and encouraging employment retention, including the following:

There is no systematic means by which employers can tap into this pool of DDU-GKY trainees for recruitment, and there is no central market for DDU-GKY candidates to search for employment.
Employers look to hire in batches but lack matching and planning tools to recruit trainees.
There is no means to level the playing field so candidates from particularly disadvantaged backgrounds can more easily connect to formal employment opportunities.
There is no matching engine that takes text format job descriptions and recommends candidates based on their profiles while keeping the unique needs of the rural youth trainee population in mind.
Trainees who migrate face many challenges related to relocation. They often lack appropriate support, leading some to leave their jobs and return home.
Employers are often wary of hiring candidates without police verification of identity and proof that they have no cases pending against them.
The challenge is to build a platform/tool which facilitates job placement and retention in a way that meets job seekers’ needs and is attractive to potential employers.

Available data: Candidate-level data capturing the following types of fields:

Candidate background: name, mobile number, gender, socio-economic status
Location: home address (including district, state), current address
Training and certification: Sector/Trade in which training received, course, duration and dates of training, level, certification agency, marks in exam
History: Highest level of education received, previous employers, last salary drawn (optional)
The location of the nearest police station to the candidate, for purposes of police verification.
A successful platform may make use of GIS data and other publicly available information on employees and employers.
